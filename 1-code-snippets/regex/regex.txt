Regex is really worth learning. Really.

Explanation of regex:

^ means at the start of the input (either line, or string depending on the m modifier). And $ means at the end.
? means optional, or if used with * or + means least
* means zero or more
+ means one or more
. means any character, so if you want jut a dot, then use \. as it must be escaped.
[a-z0-9_] means any a to z, 0 to 9, and a underscore character.
[^a-z] means anything that is not a to z character.
() surrounds a group
$1 references the first group
